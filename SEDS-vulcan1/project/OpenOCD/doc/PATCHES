@section Patch Guidelines in a Nutshell

The patch should be against svn trunk using an SVN
diff. If you use git-svn, a git diff or patch is OK
too; likewise a quilt patch, if you use quilt.

It should be a "good patch": focus it on a single
issue, and make it be easily reviewable. Don't make
it so large that it's hard to review; split large
patches into smaller ones. (That can also help
track down bugs later on.) All patches should
be "clean", which includes preserving the existing
coding style and updating documentation as needed.j

Attach the patch to the email as a .txt file and
also write a short change log entry that maintainers
can copy and paste into the commit message

Say if it's a bugfix (describe the bug) or a new
feature. Don't expect patches to merge immediately
for the next release. Be ready to rework patches
in response to feedback.

Add yourself to the GPL copyright for non-trivial changes.

To create a patch from the command line:
@code 
	svn diff >mypatch.txt
@endcode

See: @par
	http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re09.html

Remember to use "svn add" on new files first: @par
	http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re01.html

If you have a decent SVN GUI, then that should be
able to create and apply patches as well...
